# atxgolang-logo

Proposed Logo for the [Austin Go Language User
Group](http://www.meetup.com/atxgolang/).

`atxgolang.svg` was created using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) with the
following sources:

- `gopher.svg` was created by converting
  [this](http://golang.org/doc/gopher/gopherbw.png) (Creative Commons
  Attribution 3.0 License) to SVG format using
  [potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/).

- `hat.svg` was acquired from
  [clipartist.net](http://clipartist.info/openclipart.org/2011/Sept/September/11-Sunday/Cowboy_hat.svg)
  (Public Domain).
